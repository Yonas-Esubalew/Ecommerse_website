## üöÄ Getting Started

Clone the project repository using Git.  
Navigate into the project folder and install dependencies for both backend and frontend using `npm install`.  
Create a `.env` file inside the `backend` directory to hold environment variables including your MongoDB URI, JWT secret, and Stripe secret.  
Start the backend server using `npm run dev`.  
Start the frontend server using `npm run dev` or `npm start`.  
Access the application at `http://localhost:3000`.

## üåê Deployment

Frontend is deployed on Vercel. During deployment, ensure that environment variables are added with a `CRA_` prefix (e.g., `REACT_APP_API_URL`) to work properly with Vite or Create React App.

Backend is deployed using Railway. Push the backend code to GitHub and connect it with Railway. Set environment variables such as `MONGO_URI`, `JWT_SECRET`, and `STRIPE_SECRET` in the Railway dashboard. Railway auto-detects and deploys Node.js apps. Ensure the backend has the correct start script like `"start": "node server.js"`.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the backend folder with the following keys

MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key STRIPE_SECRET=your_stripe_secret_key

Never expose this file. It's already included in `.gitignore`.
For frontend on Vercel, define the following environment variable:
REACT_APP_API_URL=https://backend.up.railway.app

This will make sure API requests are routed to your deployed backend.

## üí° Usage

Register or log in as a user to access the store.  
Browse cakes by category or keyword.  
Add products to cart and proceed to checkout using Stripe.  
View past orders and order details from the profile section.  
Admins can access the admin panel to manage cakes and orders.

---

## üõ† Customization

You can replace product images, update text content, or change the theme using Tailwind utility classes.  
Easily integrate new payment methods or enhance the admin dashboard with analytics.  
To localize or translate the app, use a library like `react-i18next`.
